# solar-power-vacuum-cleaning-robot

The Solar Powered Autonomous Vacuum Cleaner Robot is a simulation-based robotics project designed using Webots, a widely used open-source robot simulator. The objective of this project is to develop an autonomous cleaning robot that simulates intelligent behavior such as navigating towards dust particles, cleaning them in the presence of obstacles, monitoring battery levels, and autonomously returning to a designated solar charging zone when power is low. This project reflects foundational concepts in robotics, including control systems, sensor integration, and environment-based decision making.
